# Decision-Tree
Pattern Recognition homework3 in NYCU 

This project is to implement the Decision Tree, AdaBoost and Random Forest algorithm by using only NumPy.

The sample code can be download in this [link](https://github.com/NCTU-VRDL/CS_AT0828/tree/main/HW3).

## Requirement
```bash
$ conda create --name PR python=3.8 -y
$ conda activate PR
$ conda install matplotlib pandas scikit-learn -y
```
## Training & Evaluation

You can use the following command to train different model. After training the model, the program will automatically evaluate the model.

```bash
python 310551031_HW3.py
```

## Result
This model can achieves 0.9 on testing data.
